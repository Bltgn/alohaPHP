alohaPHP
========
A dark color theme for Netbeans 7.2 updated for PHP

AlohaPHP is a modified version of the Aloha color theme by Mike McKinney.
This theme featured a good contrast of warm colors, easing the readability of code. Unfortunately
it didn't color the PHP features ending with black on dark code. Annotations were also not updated
causing them to display bright colors with bright code.

This theme is an effort in providing a ready to use dark theme for PHP developpers. In addition of
the original theme, it will color class attributes in order to pick them appart from method calls
as well as various elements of the PHP 5.4 syntax.

Installation
------------
* Download this repo as a ZIP archive
* In netbeans open the options window and import the settings archive

* Delete the config/Editors/AnnotationTypes subfolder
* Archive the settings as a ZIP and import them in Netbeans
